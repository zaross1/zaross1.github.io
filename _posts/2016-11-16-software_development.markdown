I got a degree in humanities, but I wasn't particularly interested in teaching, or pursuing the low paying jobs available in my area. So, I figured I'd give programming a shot. And so far, I'm loving it -- a nice combination of the creative and logical. Looking forward to completing the bootcamp =)
